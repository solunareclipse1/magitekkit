It is speculated that there is an artifact that must be obtained to allow for this, known as a $(#b52f6d)$(l)Philosopher's Stone$(), but no proof of the objects existence has ever been found. That doesn't mean no progress has been made however."

How it interacts seems to be incredibly inconsistent, ranging from simply making sparks to wiping both the object and the dust from existence.$(br2)Some objects seem to fuse with the dust, creating magical trinkets. Take a look at the other entries in this book for more information on those."

Exposing this substance to intense light, such as direct sunlight, makes it quickly begin glowing more and more. The amount of light it emits increases over thr course of a few seconds, until it is impossible to look at. After roughly 15 seconds, it ceases to exist.$(br)$(4)This 'light absorbing' property may prove useful, but more research must be done."
