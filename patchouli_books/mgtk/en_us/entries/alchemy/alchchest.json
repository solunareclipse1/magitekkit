Weaving some magical textiles together around an alchemical chest, along with some covalence dust and shulker shells, creates a curious pouch. This pouch retains all of the features of its chest form, along with a new one: privacy. Each individual who reaches into the bag is presented with a different inventory. Dying the bag changes the inventory presented, and bags of the same hue sync with each other."
