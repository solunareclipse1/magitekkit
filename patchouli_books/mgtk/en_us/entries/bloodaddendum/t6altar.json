No, that can't be right."

I have attempted making a tier 6 blood orb, but I have not yet been successful, and I'm out of ideas. The more I research raw souls, the more it seems like I was wrong about how powerful they are. A failure now would prove disastrous, as I am running out of time, $(4)so I must find a way to unleash the power within these soon."
