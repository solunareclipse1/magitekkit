Placing it in a crafting grid seems to invert this behavior, and its appearance can be changed by crafting it with any block. I have also noticed that it seems to react to vis in the aura in some way. I should experiment more with it."

The block is extremely light, its density being barely greater than that of air, so I believe increasing the density could give interesting results. I have so far failed in compressing it with force, but perhaps that is the wrong approach. Its strange reaction with vis may be a clue, though I am currently a bit stumped.$(br2)$(4)Perhaps I should look for a way to transform things with thaumaturgy?"
