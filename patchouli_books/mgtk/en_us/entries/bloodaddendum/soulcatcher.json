If they accept the offering, they will summon a being of ethereal nature for you. I have not yet documented all of them, but there is one quirk of these deals that is of great interest to me."

What is most curious however is the occasional small blue spirit they provide, which I am calling a Lost Soul. They do not seem very keen on staying though, as they vanish after only a few seconds. This makes experimenting with them very frustrating."
