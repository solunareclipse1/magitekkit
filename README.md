A modpack for Minecraft.

This project attempts to have a unique identity, to set it apart from the sea of other quest-based and kitchen-sink modpacks.
It does so using the following "theses":
  - A defined, but somewhat loose, progression, attempting to merge the kitchen-sink "feel" with the better defined goals of a quest pack.
  - Major changes to mod functionality & content to fit the needs of the project, by any means necessary.
  - A bit of mild storytelling / lore to add some flavor, but kept vague enough to let players use their own imagination.
  - An attempt to avoid anything "grindy", while still giving a sense of accomplishment for major milestones.
  - Encouraging players to use lots of cross-mod interactions to create interesting and fun-to-watch automation setups.

General inspiration for much of this pack comes from:
  - [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create)
  - [Tekkit Classic](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkit.552560)
  - [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)

This is a passion project that has been slowly being worked & iterated on since around 2017.
In that time, it has changed significantly from humble beginnings as just another kitchen sink.

This serves as the main GitHub repository for the modpack, and can be used to get a "development version" of the pack.
***Mod jar files are not included here***, so you will need to get those separately.
You can either download a public version of the pack and use that, or manually download the mods using the modlist in this repository.
