It is extremely common, can support a variety of different creatures, is essential for most vegetation, and occasionally falls from the sky.$(br2)Even with all that, I believe it still has potential yet untapped. When it comes in contact with lava, some kind of smoke is created. Perhaps it is magical in nature?"

Brewing also makes use of water, and also involves the remains of blazes, fire elementals from the nether.$(br2)I think that may be something worth investigating, so I have decided to attempt the capture of a living blaze.
